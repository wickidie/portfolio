## Overview
This is a game where you must move the player to the yellow finish tile while avoiding cliffs and finding the shortest path. The level is surrounded by dark blue walls, which the player cannot pass through. Green tiles serve as safe spaces, while red tiles represent cliffs stepping on one will teleport the player back to the white starting tile.

Although the game itself is easy to solve, it serves as an excellent environment for testing and experimenting with reinforcement learning techniques.

Below is a short clip showing the agentâ€™s training process. In my case, training takes around 10-20 minutes, depending on how long you choose to let the agent train.

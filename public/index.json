The AI agent is trained using the AgentRL plugin, which integrates Stable-Baselines3 as the reinforcement learning framework and TensorBoard for data logging and visualization.\nThe game ends when the pole tilts beyond a certain angle or moves out of the arena. Balancing the pole manually is quite challenging for human players, as it requires extremely fast reaction times to counteract the pole’s rapid movements.\nBelow is a short clip showing the agent’s training process. In my case, training takes around 4–5 hours, depending on how long you choose to let the agent train.\nTools and Frameworks Used # List the tools and frameworks:\nGodot AgentRL Godot Plugin (Godot Plugin for ) Stable-baselines3 (Reinforcement learning framework) TensorBoard (Tracking and visualizing tools) Screenshots # ","date":"1 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/portfolio/projects/2025-cartpole/","section":"Projects","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA game that can be played by human player or AI agent to balance the pole with moving cart.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"CartPole","type":"projects"},{"content":"A game where you must move the player to the finish, playable by either a human player or an AI agent.\nOverview # This is a game where you must move the player to the yellow finish tile while avoiding cliffs and finding the shortest path. The level is surrounded by dark blue walls, which the player cannot pass through. Green tiles serve as safe spaces, while red tiles represent cliffs stepping on one will teleport the player back to the white starting tile.\nAlthough the game itself is easy to solve, it serves as an excellent environment for testing and experimenting with reinforcement learning techniques.\nBelow is a short clip showing the agent’s training process. In my case, training takes around 10-20 minutes, depending on how long you choose to let the agent train.\nTools and Frameworks Used # List the tools and frameworks:\nGodot AgentRL Godot Plugin (Godot Plugin for ) Stable-baselines3 (Reinforcement learning framework) TensorBoard (Tracking and visualizing tools) Screenshots # ","date":"1 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/portfolio/projects/2025-cliffwalking/","section":"Projects","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA game where you must move the player to the finish, playable by either a human player or an AI agent.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"CliffWalking","type":"projects"},{"content":"A game where your dodge your cursor from the moving balls.\nOverview # This is a simple game where players must dodge a flying ball by moving their cursor.
